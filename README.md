| [Adaptive Conformal Predictions for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07282.pdf)| ICML | 2022| [code](https://github.com/mzaffran/adaptiveconformalpredictionstimeseries) | | Uncertainty quantification of predictive models is crucial in decision-making problems. Conformal prediction is a general and theoretically sound answer. However, it requires exchangeable data, excluding time series. While recent works tackled this issue, we argue that Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI, Gibbs and Candes` , 2021), developed for distribution-shift time series, is a good procedure for time series with general dependency. We theoretically analyse the impact of the learning rate on its efficiency in the exchangeable and auto-regressive case. We propose a parameter-free method, AgACI, that adaptively builds upon ACI based on online expert aggregation. We lead extensive fair simulations against competing methods that advocate for ACI‚Äôs use in time series. We conduct a real case study: electricity price forecasting. The proposed aggregation algorithm provides efficient prediction intervals for day-ahead forecasting. All the code and data to reproduce the experiments is made available.|

| :--------------------------: | :-------------------: | :------------------: |:------ |
|[üìö Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts)| Unit8 | ‚≠êÔ∏è 5.3K | Darts is a Python library for user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on time series. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. The forecasting models can all be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn. The library also makes it easy to backtest models, combine the predictions of several models, and take external data into account. Darts supports both univariate and multivariate time series and models. The ML-based models can be trained on potentially large datasets containing multiple time series, and some of the models offer a rich support for probabilistic forecasting.
|[üìö Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)| Meta (Facebook) | ‚≠êÔ∏è 15.5K | Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
|[üìö Neural Prophet](https://github.com/ourownstory/neural_prophet)| - | ‚≠êÔ∏è 2.8K | A Neural Network based Time-Series model, inspired by Facebook Prophet and AR-Net, built on PyTorch.

|[üìö stumpy](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy)| TD Ameritrade | ‚≠êÔ∏è 2.5K | STUMPY is a powerful and scalable Python library that efficiently computes something called the matrix profile, which is just an academic way of saying "for every subsequence within your time series, automatically identify its corresponding nearest-neighbor". What's important is that once you've computed your matrix profile (middle panel above) it can then be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks.
|[üìö tsfresh](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh)| Blue Yonder GmbH | ‚≠êÔ∏è 7K | The package provides systematic time-series feature extraction by combining established algorithms from statistics, time-series analysis, signal processing, and nonlinear dynamics with a robust feature selection algorithm. In this context, the term time-series is interpreted in the broadest possible sense, such that any types of sampled data or even event sequences can be characterised.
|[üìö SKTIME](https://github.com/sktime/sktime)| - | ‚≠êÔ∏è 6.1K | sktime is a library for time series analysis in Python. It provides a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks. Currently, this includes time series classification, regression, clustering, annotation and forecasting. It comes with time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools to build, tune and validate time series models.
|[üìö pmdarima](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima)| - | ‚≠êÔ∏è 1.3K | Pmdarima (originally pyramid-arima, for the anagram of 'py' + 'arima') is a statistical library designed to fill the void in Python's time series analysis capabilities.

It also includes a large battery of benchmarking models.
|[üìö Streamz](https://github.com/python-streamz/streamz)| - | ‚≠êÔ∏è 1.1K | Streamz helps you build pipelines to manage continuous streams of data. It is simple to use in simple cases, but also supports complex pipelines that involve branching, joining, flow control, feedback, back pressure, and so on.
|[üìö PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS)| - | ‚≠êÔ∏è 613 | A Python toolbox for machine learning on Partially-Observed Time Series.

|[Monash Time Series Forecasting Repository](https://forecastingdata.org/)| NeurIPS | 2021 | [paper link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wEc1mgAjU-) |There have been many deep time series evaluated on the same datasets in recent years. Even though this works for basic benchmarking, it may not hold up when applied to a variety of temporal tasks. Its goal is to create a "master list" of different time series datasets and serve as an authoritative benchmark. Over 20 different datasets are included in the repository, spanning industries as diverse as health, retail, ride-share, and demographics.
|[Revisiting Time Series Outlier Detection: Definitions and Benchmarks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8IvOsnHchr)| NeurIPS | 2021 | [link](https://github.com/datamllab/tods/tree/benchmark) |This paper critiques many existing time series anomaly/outlier detection datasets and proposes 35 brand-new synthetic datasets and 4 real-world datasets for benchmarking purposes. 
|[Subseasonal Forecasting Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/subseasonal-climate-forecasting/)| Microsoft | 2021 | [link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/subseasonal-climate-forecasting/downloads/) |Microsoft has released a dataset to facilitate machine learning for improving subseasonal forecasting (e.g. two to six weeks in the future). Forecasting subseasonally helps government agencies and farmers prepare for weather events. In general, deep learning models performed quite poorly compared to other methods in Microsoft's benchmark. A simple feed-forward model proved to be the most accurate DL model, while the Informer performed poorly.
