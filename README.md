| [Adaptive Conformal Predictions for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07282.pdf)| ICML | 2022| [code](https://github.com/mzaffran/adaptiveconformalpredictionstimeseries) | | Uncertainty quantification of predictive models is crucial in decision-making problems. Conformal prediction is a general and theoretically sound answer. However, it requires exchangeable data, excluding time series. While recent works tackled this issue, we argue that Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI, Gibbs and Candes` , 2021), developed for distribution-shift time series, is a good procedure for time series with general dependency. We theoretically analyse the impact of the learning rate on its efficiency in the exchangeable and auto-regressive case. We propose a parameter-free method, AgACI, that adaptively builds upon ACI based on online expert aggregation. We lead extensive fair simulations against competing methods that advocate for ACI’s use in time series. We conduct a real case study: electricity price forecasting. The proposed aggregation algorithm provides efficient prediction intervals for day-ahead forecasting. All the code and data to reproduce the experiments is made available.|

| [SOM-VAE: Interpretable Discrete Representation Learning on Time Series](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rygjcsR9Y7) | ICLR | 2019 | -| - | The SOM-VAE can recover topologically interpretable state representations on time series and static data. It provides an improvement to standard methods in terms of clustering performance and offers a way to learn discrete two-dimensional representations of the data manifold in concurrence with the reconstruction task. |
